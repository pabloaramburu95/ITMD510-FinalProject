This is the final project for ITMD 510. 

In glucose treatments it is required to have a constant monitoring of the patient and his glucose levels in blood in order to be able to detect any problem or any necessary change in the treatment. This project is about being able to do so by providing a system where it is possible to track the illness, study its evolution and other interesting information. 
There are three types of users in this proposal:

 - Patient. The patient can upload or delete glucose measurements by filling the provided form. In addition, he can post any relevant information about the illness or his thoughts in a post where he can also see other usersâ€™ posts.
 - Doctor. Every doctor has allocated patients. He can see every measurement and update the treatment of his patients.
 - Administrator. This user is the only allowed to delete both patients and doctors in the system.
